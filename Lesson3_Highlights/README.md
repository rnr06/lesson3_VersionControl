In this assignment you have to create a new workspace in Cloud9 using the Bootstrap template provided. You then need to list five key concepts that you learned in Lesson 3 and summarize those five concepts on a webpage modifying the files you downloaded from Lesson3_Highlights.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.
2. A versioning control system, or VCS, is a system that automatically tracks who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and then merges the changes to the same file.
3. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
