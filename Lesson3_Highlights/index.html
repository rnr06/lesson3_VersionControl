            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the user making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. Software developers sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and configuration files as well as source code. This topic interests me because I believe that it is something that every web developed should know and understand. I believe that version control is relevant to this course for the exact same reason.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A versioning control system, or VCS, is a system that automatically tracks who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and then merges the changes to the same file. Some of the many benefits of VCS is that files cannot be overwritten so there is never any lost data. This also makes it possible that multiple people can work on the same files or projects simultaneously without any conflicts or lost data, the files cannot be overwritten. Another benefit of versioning control systems is that it allows you to revert back to an older version of the file or project if you ever needed to. Versioning control systems have benefits even if you do not work with a team because it automatically backups your files so you never lose anything and won’t ever have to start the same project over again. This topic interests me because it is always nice to know that I will never lose anything that I am working on, because it has happened many times in the past and can be very frustrating. This topic is relevant to this course because it is definitely something that every Information Technology student should know.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses supply chain management tools with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. There are three basic steps of git, add commit, and push. You first have to add a working copy of your project to a n index or staging area, next you commit that project to a local repository, then you push your project to a remote repository. Basic git commands are: git init, git add –all, git commit -am ‘Initial commit’, git log, and git status. Three remote git commands are: git remote, git pull, and git push. Git is good to use because every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their own machine, everything is local so you can work offline if needed, there is no single point of failure, processes run faster, and git will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. This concept interests me because I have never learned about it before and would like to learn more. Git is relevant is this course because it seems that every web developer should know everything there is to know about git.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Users can pay for GitHub or the can use it for free and to host open-source software products. I am interested in this topic because I have never used it before and would like to learn more about it and to understand it better. I believe that this topic is relevant to this course for the same reason. We’re learning about the development of web applications and should understand this product.</p>
